# 🧠 PDDL Planner Benchmark Comparison

This project compares two **PDDL planners** — [**HSP**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bonner/courses/2018s/csc2516/hsp-planner.pdf) and a **SAT-based planner** — across several benchmark domains.  
It runs both planners on selected problems, measures **runtime** and **makespan**, and generates **comparison plots**.

## 📦 Requirements

### ✅ Software

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- **Java 17**  
  Tested with: `openjdk version "17.0.15"`  
  → [Download Java](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/)

- **Apache Maven**  
  Tested with: `Apache Maven 3.9.10`  
  → [install Maven]
- windows : ```bash
  choco install maven
  ```
  if choco is not installed : ```bash
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
  ```
- MacOS : 
```bash
  brew install maven
  ```

- Linux : 
```bash
sudo apt install maven
  ```

- **Python 3.10+**  

  Install the required Python package: 

  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Compile the SAT-based Planner

```bash
cd sat
mvn compile
cd ..
```

### 2. Run the Benchmark Script

```bash
python script.py
```

This script will:
- Run both **HSP** and **SATPlanner** on the benchmark problems.
- Measure **runtime** and **makespan**.
- Create a `figures/` directory containing comparison plots for each domain.

Plots include:
- 🕒 **Runtime Comparison**
- 📏 **Makespan (Plan Length) Comparison**

---

## 🔍 View Generated Plans

To inspect the plans generated by the **SAT-based planner** manually:

```bash
cd sat             # Move into the sat directory where the pom.xml is located
mvn compile        # Compile the Java code
```

Then run the planner with a domain and problem file:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="path_to_domain path_to_problem"
```

### 🔧 Example

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="test/resources/benchmarks/pddl/ipc2000/blocks/strips-typed/domain.pddl test/resources/benchmarks/pddl/ipc2000/blocks/strips-typed/p001.pddl"
```


## 📌 Notes

- Plans are not printed by default during benchmarking — only runtime and makespan are recorded.
- Make sure file paths to the domain and problem files are valid when using the `exec:java` command.
